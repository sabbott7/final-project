# Instructions for Running my Project


Battleship Introduction:

This project is a version of the classic board game Battleship except. In this challenge - it’s you (the player) versus the computer (the enemy). A single ship is hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. The player will have 10 attempts to enter the row/column co-ordinates to try to sink the ship and win the game.

Goal	: Sink the computer’s battleship in the fewest number of guesses

Setup	: When program is launched, the computer places a battleship on a virtual 5x5 grid. When that’s done, the game asks for your first guess.
  
How you play: The game will prompt you to enter a guess and you’ll type in a grid location. In response to your guess, you’ll see a result of “Hit. You sunk my battleship!” or “You missed. You got me!” .The game ends listing your number of strikes, and the actual location of the computers battleship. Happy Hunting!
